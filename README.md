#### As for the icon

When the app is finished, you may notice it lacks an icon. To remedy this, do the following:
1. Find the app in the Finder at `/Applications/Pomodoro\ Timer.app`
2. Select it and press `Command-I`
3. Find the icon at `~/Library/Application\ Support/Pomodoro\ Timer/pomodoro.png`, and open it in Preview
4. Press `Command-A`, then press `Command-C`
5. Close Preview
6. Click to select the icon on the *top left* of the *Pomodoro Timer.app Info* window. **A blue glow should surround the icon, showing selection**
7. Press `Command-V`
8. Close the window. Check Launchpad - the icon should have changed.
